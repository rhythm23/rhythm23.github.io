        <h1>Fit, Not Fast</h1>
        <p>I love fitness and keeping fit. But I hate sport and an over-reliance on gadgets. This is a place safe for cyclists who hate the Tour de France, runners who couldn't give a monkeys about the Flora Marathon and folk who like throwing a frisbee around wothout caring about keeping score.</p>
        <p>Functional fitness is the order of the day here. Fitting fitness into everyday life.</p>
        <h2>"Everyday fitness?"</h2>

        <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
        <h2>Where can I do it?</h2>
